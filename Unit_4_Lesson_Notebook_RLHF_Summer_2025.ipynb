The notebook is motivated by (and the RLHF training part is - with some modifications - essentially directly taken from) **an example from Huggingface's TRL library**, published [here](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/blob/main/examples/notebooks/gpt2-sentiment.ipynb) and released under a Apache 2 license.\n","\n","\n","Here is the logic of what we want to do:\n","\n","1. We will use a further fine-tune version of GPT-2, which has been further pre-trained on the IMDB dataset language ('[lvwerra/gpt2-imdb](https://huggingface.co/lvwerra/gpt2-imdb)').\n","\n","2. We use an existing sentiment classification model as a **reward model**. The reference notebook uses the fine-tuned BERT-like model '[lvwerra/distilbert-imdb](https://huggingface.co/lvwerra/distilbert-imdb)'. This saves us the effort to train a separate reward model. (Not that we do not want to train for actual instructions but completions, which in the end is quite a bit simpler in that one actually can train directly a reward model directly on example/label pairs vs preference data (instruction - chosen answer - rejected answer).)\n","\n","3. We will then use the IMDB dataset as a training dataset. (We will only look at a few batches, as this procedure is really slow for RLHF and computation-wise expensive.) We will prepare the dataset as follows:  \n","   a) for each example we take a short segment at the very beginning as the 'prompt'.   \n","   b) We will then use the language model to generate **two** completions.    \n","   c) We will then use the reward model to: i) assign a score for either completion, and ii) determine which one of the two completions is preferred.   \n","\n","4. Then we will train our models (keeping the reference models fixed). We will do so for        \n","   a) RHLF/PPO  \n","   \n","\n","5. We will then compare completions and their sentiment before and after having done a few training batches.\n","\n","This notebook is designed for a quick illustration. To get more reliable results you should run the training longer (see the original notebook). We would also encourage you to look at some of the other details.\n","\n","This notebook can be run on a T4 processor and higher. (A L4 (on Colab Pro) is maybe 20% faster for the notebook that T4).\n","\n","A Hugging Face blog post that compares DPO, IPO (a DPO variant) and paired KTO tests can be found here: https://huggingface.co/blog/pref-tuning . (For this term's notebook version, we excluded the original DPO and pair-wise KTO computation - which used the DPO Trainer with a KTO loss as described in the blog post - as they are unstable.)\n","\n","**Notes:**\n","\n","1. Some text in this notebook will be generated dynamically. As we use a simple language model, the ethical quality and general appropriateness cannot be guaranteed.   \n","2. It appears that the Hugging Face PPO implementation became more efficient. The results for that method appear to be quite good for this toy example. (And it is just a toy example.)  \n"],"metadata":{"id":"FsAJUM858NVU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 0. Setup\n","\n","We run a few installations and imports.
