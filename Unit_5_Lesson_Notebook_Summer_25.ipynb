Also, we are running only a few hundred steps for the training runs, obviously affecting the results. Hyperparameter tuning also wasn't done. **So the purpose of this notebook is to introduce and test the ideas, not to conduct a detailed comparison.**\n","\n","We will use the Stanford Sentiment Treebank as a dataset to compare the models.
